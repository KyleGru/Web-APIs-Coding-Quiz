# Web-APIs-Coding-Quiz

## Description
I have created a coding quiz using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The functionality of this website allows the user to begin a timed coding quiz by pressing a start button. They are then presented with a series of questions with four options for an answer to choose from. When they click one of the selctions they will be presented with an alert that lets them know if their selection in correct or incorrect. If the answer is incorrect the time they have to complete the quiz will be reduced by 10 seconds. When the user completes the quiz they will be presented with a screen that allows them to enter their initials and log their score (the amount of time left) to a Highscores page. If the user does not complete the quiz in the allotted time they will be directed to the same screen with a text score of "Out of Time". 

I made this quiz with the following files
-index.html
-scores.htlm
-style.css
-script.js
-score.js
-questions.js

The use of multiple HTML and JS files allowed me to oraganize my code in a clean and easy to read format.
